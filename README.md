# The story behind TechHub
In a male-dominated industry, girls and women struggle in kick-starting their journey in the field of programming without the proper guidance and resources, 
coding can seem confusing, exhausting and sometimes really expensive, especially in Egypt. 
My goal here is to help you take your first steps into the world of coding by gathering free resources 
and show you inspiring stories of other females who conquered the Egyptian societyâ€™s stereotypes.
This Project was made during the `Girls Who Code` summer program as part of the **Web development for social good** course.
